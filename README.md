# windows-shutdown-timer
A little Tkinter GUI for a Windows only shutdown timer or restarter. I made this for myself really, but there may be others out there that find a use for the code, or even the program itself ðŸ¦–.

The one thing that really pleased me was how smoothly you can move the GUI about, because I used of "After" for the timer, rather than lazily using sleep, which would make it freeze up and jerk about the place if you had the termerity to try and move the app around the screen a bit :-)
