# windows-shutdown-timer
A little Tkinter GUI for a Windows only shutdown timer or restarter. I made this for myself really but there maybe one other sad-o out there that may find a use for the bad code, or even the program itself ðŸ¦–.

The one thing that delighted me was how smoothly you can move the GUI about because of the use of "After" for the timer, rather than the time.sleep command which would make it freeze up and the hell about the place if you tried to move it.
